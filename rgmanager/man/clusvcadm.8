.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
The
.B clusvcadm
command allows an administrator to enable, disable, relocate, and restart
user services in a cluster.  In order to perform cluster service operations,
the cluster daemons must be running (and have quorum) on the member system
on which the command is invoked.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\-d <service>"
Stops and disables the user service named
.I
service
.IP "\-e <service>"
Enables and starts the user service named
.I
service
.IP \-l
Lock the local resource group manager.  This should only be used if the 
administrator intends to perform a global, cluster-wide shutdown.  This
prevents starting resource groups on the local node, allowing 
services will not fail over during the shutdown of the cluster.
Once the cluster quorum is dissolved, this state is reset.
.IP "\-m <member>"
When used in conjunction with either the
.B
\-e
or
.B
\-r
options, this specifies the 
.I
preferred
target member on which to start the 
service.
.IP "\-r <service>"
Relocates the user service named
.I
service
to another cluster member.
.IP "\-R <service>"
Restarts the user service named
.I
service
on the cluster member on which it is currently running.
.IP "\-Z <service>"
Freezes the service named
.I
service
on the cluster member on which it is currently running.  This will
prevent status checks of the service as well as failover in the
event the node fails or rgmanager is stopped.
.IP "\-U <service>"
Unfreezes the user service named
.I
service
on the cluster member on which it is currently running.  This will
re-enable status checks.
.IP "\-S"
Display whether each of the active service managers is locked or not.  This
can be used to verify the correct operation of the \fB-l\fR and \fB-u\fR 
options, but is only useful for debugging.
.IP "\-s <service>"
Stops the service named
.I
service
until a member transition or until it is enabled again.
.IP \-u
Unlock the cluster's service managers.  This allows services to transition
again. 

.IP \-v
Display version information and exit.

.SH "NOTES"
Executing
.I -U
(unfreeze) on a service which was frozen in the 
.B started
state while the service owner is offline results in an undefined
(and possibly dangerous) condition.  Manually ensure all resources are
clear before doing this.
