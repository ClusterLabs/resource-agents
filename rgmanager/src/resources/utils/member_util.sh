# Use corosync-quorumtool to figure out if the specified node is a member
# of the cluster.  Returns 1 if not a member, and
# 0 if the node is happily running.
#
# Tested on RHEL6 and F17  Note that the old version of this function utilized
# clustat, which had introspection in to the configuration.
# If a node was not found, the old version would return '2', but the only
# consumer of this function never cared about that value.
