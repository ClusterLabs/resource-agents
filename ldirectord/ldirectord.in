ldirectord - Linux Director Daemon

Daemon to monitor remote services and control Linux Virtual Server


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ldirectord> [B<-d|--debug>] [--] [I<configfile>]
B<start> | B<stop> | B<restart> | B<try-restart> | B<reload> | B<force-reload> | B<status>

B<ldirectord> [B<-h|-?|--help|-v|--version>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ldirectord> is a daemon to monitor and administer real servers in a
cluster of load balanced virtual servers. B<ldirectord> typically is
started from heartbeat but can also be run from the command line. On
startup B<ldirectord> reads the file B<@sysconfdir@/ha.d/conf/>I<configuration>.
After parsing the file, entries for virtual servers are created on the LVS.
Now at regular intervals the specified real servers are monitored and if
they are considered alive, added to a list for each virtual server. If a
real server fails, it is removed from that list. Only one instance of
B<ldirectord> can be started for each configuration, but more instances of
B<ldirectord> may be started for different configurations. This helps to
group clusters of services.  Normally one would put an entry inside
B<@sysconfdir@/ha.d/haresources>

I<nodename virtual-ip-address ldirectord::configuration>

to start ldirectord from heartbeat.


=head1 OPTIONS

I<configuration>:
This is the name for the configuration as specified in the file
B<@sysconfdir@/ha.d/conf/>I<configuration>

B<-d|--debug> Don't start as daemon and log verbosely.

B<-h|--help> Print user manual and exit.

B<-v|--version> Print version and exit.

B<start> the daemon for the specified configuration.

B<stop> the daemon for the specified configuration. This is the same as sending
a TERM signal to the running daemon.

B<restart> the daemon for the specified configuration. The same as stopping and starting.

B<reload> the configuration file. This is only useful for modifications
inside a virtual server entry. It will have no effect on adding or
removing a virtual server block. This is the same as sending a HUP signal to
the running daemon.

B<status> of the running daemon for the specified configuration.


=head1 SYNTAX

=head2 Description of how to write configuration files

B<virtual = >I<(ip_address|hostname:portnumber|servicename)|firewall-mark>

Defines a virtual service by IP-address (or hostname) and port (or
servicename) or firewall-mark.  A firewall-mark is an integer greater than
zero. The configuration of marking packets is controlled using the C<-m>
option to B<ipchains>(8).  All real services and flags for a virtual
service must follow this line immediately and be indented.

B<checktimeout = >I<n>

Timeout in seconds for connect, external, external-perl and ping checks. If the timeout is
exceeded then the real server is declared dead.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

If undefined then the value of negotiatetimeout is used.  negotiatetimeout
is also a global value that may be overridden by a per-virtual setting.

If both checktimeout and negotiatetimeout are unset, the default is used.

Default: 5 seconds

B<negotiatetimeout = >I<n>

Timeout in seconds for negotiate checks.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

If undefined then the value of checktimeout is used.  checktimeout is
also a global value that may be overridden by a per-virtual setting.

If both negotiatetimeout and checktimeout are unset, the default is used.

Default: 30 seconds

B<checkinterval = >I<n>

Defines the number of second between server checks.

When fork=no this option defines the amount of time ldirectord sleeps
between running all of the realserver checks in all virtual service pools.

When fork=yes this option defines the amount of time each forked child
sleeps per virtual service pool after running all realserver checks for
that pool.

If set in the virtual server section then the global value is overridden,
but ONLY if using forking mode (B<fork = >I<yes>).

Default: 10 seconds

B<checkcount = >I<n>

This option is deprecated and slated for removal in a future version.
Please see the 'failurecount' option.

The number of times a check will be attempted before it is considered to
have failed. Only works with ping checks. Note that the
checktimeout/negotiatetimeout is additive, so if a connect check is used,
checkcount is 3 and checktimeout is 2 seconds, then a total of 6 seconds
worth of timeout will occur before the check fails.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

Default: 1

B<failurecount = >I<n>

The number of consecutive times a failure will have to be reported by a
check before the realserver is considered to have failed.  A
value of 1 will have the realserver considered failed on the first failure.
A successful check will reset the failure counter to 0.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

Default: 1

B<autoreload = >B<yes> | B<no>

Defines if <ldirectord> should continuously check the configuration file
for modification. If this is set to 'yes' and the configuration file
changed on disk and its modification time (mtime) is newer than the
previous version, the configuration is automatically reloaded.

Default: no

B<callback = ">I</path/to/callback>B<">

If this directive is defined, B<ldirectord> automatically calls
the executable I</path/to/callback> after the configuration
file has changed on disk. This is useful to update the configuration
file through B<scp> on the other heartbeated host. The first argument
to the callback is the name of the configuration.

This directive might also be used to restart B<ldirectord> automatically
after the configuration file changed on disk. However, if B<autoreload>
is set to yes, the configuration is reloaded anyway.

B<fallback = >I<ip_address|hostname[:portnumber|sercvicename]> [B<gate> | B<masq> | B<ipip>]

the server onto which a webservice is redirected if all real
servers are down. Typically this would be 127.0.0.1 with
an emergency page.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

B<fallbackcommand = ">I<path to script>B<">

If this directive is defined, the supplied script is executed whenever all
real servers for a virtual service are down or when the first real server
comes up again. In the first case, it is called with "start" as its first
argument, in the latter with "stop".
Additional parameters are vserver with vport (vserver:vport) as second param
and protocol (tcp/udp) as third param to identify the virtual service
within the fallback script.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

B<logfile = ">I</path/to/logfile>B<">|syslog_facility

An alternative logfile might be specified with this directive. If the logfile
does not have a leading '/', it is assumed to be a syslog(3) facility name.

Default: log directly to the file I</var/log/ldirectord.log>.


B<emailalert = ">I<emailaddress>[, I<emailaddress>]...B<">

A valid email address for sending alerts about the changed connection status
to any real server defined in the virtual service.  This option requires
perl module MailTools to be installed.  Automatically tries to send email
using any of the built-in methods. See perldoc Mail::Mailer for more info on
methods.

Multiple addresses may be supplied, comma delimited.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.


B<emailalertfrom = >I<emailaddress>

A valid email address to use as the from address of the email alerts.  You
can use a plain email address or any RFC-compliant string for the From header
in the body of an email message (such as: "ldirectord Alerts" <alerts@example.com>)
Do not quote this string unless you want the quotes passed in as part of the
From header.

Default: unset, take system generated default (probably root@hostname)


B<emailalertfreq => I<n>

Delay in seconds between repeating email alerts while any given real server
in the virtual service remains inaccessible.  A setting of zero seconds
will inhibit the repeating alerts. The email timing accuracy of this
setting is dependent on the number of seconds defined in the checkinterval
configuration option.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

Default: 0


B<emailalertstatus = >B<all> | B<none> | B<starting> | B<running> | B<stopping> | B<reloading>,...

Comma delimited list of server states in which email alerts should be sent.
B<all> is a short-hand for
"B<starting>,B<running>,B<stopping>,B<reloading>".  If B<none> is
specified, no other option may be specified, otherwise options are ored
with each other.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

Default: all


B<smtp = >I<ip_address|hostname>B<">

A valid SMTP server address to use for sending email via SMTP.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.


B<execute = ">I<configuration>B<">

Use this directive to start an instance of ldirectord for
the named I<configuration>.


B<supervised = >B<yes> | B<no>

If I<yes>, then ldirectord does not go into background mode.
All log-messages are redirected to stdout instead of a logfile.
This is useful to run B<ldirectord> supervised from daemontools.
See http://untroubled.org/rpms/daemontools/ or http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html
for details.

Default: I<no>


B<fork = >B<yes> | B<no>

If I<yes>, then ldirectord will spawn a child process for every virtual server,
and run checks against the real servers from them.  This will increase response
times to changes in real server status in configurations with many virtual
servers.  This may also use less memory then running many separate instances of
ldirectord.  Child processes will be automatically restarted if they die.

Default: I<no>


B<quiescent = >B<yes> | B<no>

If I<yes>, then when real or failback servers are determined
to be down, they are not actually removed from the kernel's LVS
table. Rather, their weight is set to zero which means that no
new connections will be accepted.

This has the side effect, that if the real server has persistent
connections, new connections from any existing clients will continue to be
routed to the real server, until the persistent timeout can expire. See
L<ipvsadm> for more information on persistent connections.

This side-effect can be avoided by running the following:

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/vs/expire_quiescent_template

If the proc file isn't present this probably means that
the kernel doesn't have LVS support, LVS support isn't loaded,
or the kernel is too old to have the proc file. Running
ipvsadm as root should load LVS into the kernel if it is possible.

If I<no>, then the real or failback servers will be removed
from the kernel's LVS table. The default is I<yes>.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

Default: I<yes>

B<readdquiescent = >B<yes> | B<no>

If I<yes>, then when real or failback servers are determined
to be down, they are readded to the kernel's LVS table with weight 0 if
they do not exist in the table. Setting the value to no, allows manually 
removing the realserver to manually disable all persistent connections.

B<cleanstop = >B<yes> | B<no>

If I<yes>, then when ldirectord exits it will remove all of the virtual
server pools that it is managing from the kernel's LVS table.

If I<no>, then the virtual server pools it is managing and any real
or failback servers listed in them at the time ldirectord exits will
be left as-is.  If you want to be able to stop ldirectord without having
traffic to your realservers interrupted you will want to set this to I<no>.

If defined in a virtual server section then the global value is overridden.

Default: I<yes>


B<maintenancedir = >I<directoryname>

If this option is set ldirectord will look for a special file in the specified
directory and, if found, force the status of the real server identified by the
file to down, skipping the normal health check.  This would be useful if you
wish to force servers down for maintenance without having to modify the actual
ldirectord configuration file.

For example, given a realserver with IP 172.16.1.2, service on port 4444, and
a resolvable reverse DNS entry pointing to "realserver2.example.com" ldirectord
will check for the existence of the following files:

=over

=item 172.16.1.2:4444

=item 172.16.1.2

=item realserver2.example.com:4444

=item realserver2.example.com

=item realserver2:4444

=item realserver2

=back

If any one of those files is found then ldirectord will immediately force the
status of the server to down as if the check had failed.

Note: Since it checks for the IP/hostname without the port this means you can
decide to place an entire realserver into maintenance across a large number of
virtual service pools with a single file (if you were going to reboot the server,
for instance) or include the port number and put just a particular service into
maintenance.

This option is not valid in a virtual server section.

Default: disabled


=head2 Section virtual

The following commands must follow a B<virtual> entry and must be indented
with a minimum of 4 spaces or one tab.

B<real => I<ip_address|hostname[-E<gt>ip_address|hostname][:portnumber|servicename>] B<gate> | B<masq> | B<ipip> [I<weight>] [B<">I<request>B<", ">I<receive>B<">]

Defines a real service by IP-address (or hostname) and port (or
servicename). If the port is omitted then a 0 will be used, this is
intended primarily for fwmark services where the port for real servers is
ignored. Optionally a range of IPv4 addresses (or two hostnames) may be
given, in which case each IPv4 address in the range will be treated as a real
server using the given port. The second argument defines the forwarding
method, must be B<gate>, B<ipip> or B<masq>.  The third argument is
optional and defines the weight for that real server. If omitted then a
weight of 1 will be used. The last two arguments are also optional. They
define a request-receive pair to be used to check if a server is alive.
They override the request-receive pair in the virtual server section. These
two strings must be quoted. If the request string starts with I<http://...>
the IP-address and port of the real server is overridden, otherwise the
IP-address and port of the real server is used.

=head2
For TCP and UDP (non fwmark) virtual services, unless the forwarding method
is B<masq> and the IP address of a real server is non-local (not present on
a interface on the host running ldirectord) then the port of the real
server will be set to that of its virtual service. That is, port-mapping is
only available to if the real server is another machine and the forwarding
method is B<masq>.  This is due to the way that the underlying LVS code in
the kernel functions.

=head2
More than one of these entries may be inside a virtual section.  The
checktimeout, negotiatetimeout, checkcount, fallback, emailalert,
emailalertfreq and quiescent options listed above may also appear inside a
virtual section, in which case the global setting is overridden.

B<checktype =
>B<connect> | B<external> | B<external-perl> | B<negotiate> | B<off> | B<on> | B<ping> | B<checktimeout>I<N>

Type of check to perform. Negotiate sends a request and matches a receive
string. Connect only attempts to make a TCP/IP connection, thus the
request and receive strings may be omitted.  If checktype is a number then
negotiate and connect is combined so that after each N connect attempts one
negotiate attempt is performed. This is useful to check often if a service
answers and in much longer intervals a negotiating check is done. Ping
means that ICMP ping will be used to test the availability of real servers.
Ping is also used as the connect check for UDP services. Off means no
checking will take place and no real or fallback servers will be activated.
On means no checking will take place and real servers will always be
activated. Default is I<negotiate>.

B<service = >B<dns> | B<ftp> | B<http> | B<https> | B<http_proxy> | B<imap> | B<imaps> | B<ldap> | B<mysql> | B<nntp> | B<none> | B<oracle> | B<pgsql> | B<pop> | B<pops> | B<radius> | B<simpletcp> | B<sip> | B<smtp> | B<submission>

The type of service to monitor when using checktype=negotiate. None denotes
a service that will not be monitored.

simpletcp sends the B<request> string to the server and tests it against
the B<receive> regexp. The other types of checks connect to the server
using the specified protocol. Please see the B<request> and B<receive>
sections for protocol specific information.

Default:

=over 4

=item * Virtual server port is 21: ftp

=item * Virtual server port is 25: smtp

=item * Virtual server port is 53: dns

=item * Virtual server port is 80: http

=item * Virtual server port is 110: pop

=item * Virtual server port is 119: nntp

=item * Virtual server port is 143: imap

=item * Virtual server port is 389: ldap

=item * Virtual server port is 443: https

=item * Virtual server port is 587: submission

=item * Virtual server port is 993: imaps

=item * Virtual server port is 995: pops

=item * Virtual server port is 1521: oracle

=item * Virtual server port is 1812: radius

=item * Virtual server port is 3128: http_proxy

=item * Virtual server port is 3306: mysql

=item * Virtual server port is 5432: pgsql

=item * Virtual server port is 5060: sip

=item * Otherwise: none

=back


B<checkcommand = ">I<path to script>B<">

This setting is used if checktype is external or external-perl and is the command to be run
to check the status of a real server. It should exit with status 0 if
everything is ok, or non-zero otherwise.

Four parameters are passed to the script:

=over 4

=item * virtual server ip/firewall mark

=item * virtual server port

=item * real server ip

=item * real server port

=back

If the checktype is external-perl then the command is assumed to be a
Perl script and it is evaluated into an anonymous subroutine which is
called at check time, avoiding a fork-exec.  The argument signature and
exit code conventions are identical to checktype external.  That is, an
external-perl checktype should also work as an external checktype.

Default: /bin/true

B<checkport = >I<n>

Number of port to monitor. Sometimes check port differs from service port.

Default: port specified for each real server

B<request = ">I<uri to requested object>B<">

This object will be requested each checkinterval seconds on each real
server.  The string must be inside quotes. Note that this string may be
overridden by an optional per real-server based request-string.

For an HTTP/HTTPS check, this should be a relative URI, while it has to
be absolute for the 'http_proxy' check type. In the latter case, this
URI will be requested through the proxy backend that is being checked.

For a DNS check this should the name of an A record, or the address
of a PTR record to look up.

For a MySQL, Oracle or PostgeSQL check, this should be an SQL SELECT query.
The data returned is not checked, only that the
answer is one or more rows.  This is a required setting.

For a simpletcp check, this string is sent verbatim except any occurrences
of \n are replaced with a new line character.

B<receive = ">I<regexp to compare>B<">

If the requested result contains this I<regexp to compare>, the real server
is declared alive. The regexp must be inside quotes. Keep in mind that
regexps are not plain strings and that you need to escape the special
characters if they should as literals. Note that this regexp may be
overridden by an optional per real-server based receive regexp.

For a DNS check this should be any one the A record's addresses or
any one of the PTR record's names.
In case of dynamic DNS answers (different answers on the same question)
a regex to match multiple addresses or PTR record names could also defined.

For a MySQL check, the receive setting is not used.

B<httpmethod = GET> | B<HEAD>

Sets the HTTP method which should be used to fetch the URI specified in
the request-string. GET is the method used by default if the parameter is
not set. If HEAD is used, the receive-string should be unset.

Default: GET

B<virtualhost = ">I<hostname>B<">

Used when using a negotiate check with HTTP or HTTPS. Sets the host header
used in the HTTP request.  In the case of HTTPS this generally needs to
match the common name of the SSL certificate. If not set then the host
header will be derived from the request url for the real server if present.
As a last resort the IP address of the real server will be used.

B<login = ">I<username>B<">

For FTP, IMAP, LDAP, MySQL, Oracle, POP and PostgreSQL, the username
used to log in.

For Radius the username is used for the attribute User-Name.

For SIP, the username is used as both the to and from address for an
OPTIONS query.

Default:

=over 4

=item * FTP: Anonymous

=item * MySQL Oracle, and PostgreSQL: Must be specified in the configuration

=item * SIP: ldirectord\@<hostname>, hostname is derived as per the passwd
	option below.

=item * Otherwise: empty string, which denotes that
	case authentication will not be attempted.

=back

B<passwd = ">I<password>B<">

Password to use to login to FTP, IMAP, LDAP, MySQL, Oracle, POP, PostgreSQL
and SIP servers.

For Radius the passwd is used for the attribute User-Password.

Default:

=over 4

=item * FTP: ldirectord\@<hostname>,
	where hostname is the environment variable HOSTNAME evaluated at
	run time, or sourced from uname if unset.

=item * Otherwise: empty string.
	In the case of LDAP, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL this means
	that authentication will not be performed.

=back

B<database = ">I<databasename>B<">

Database to use for MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL servers, this is the
database that the query (set by B<receive> above) will be performed
against.  This is a required setting.

B<secret = ">I<radiussecret>B<">

Secret to use for Radius servers, this is the secret used to perform an
Access-Request with the username (set by B<login> above) and passwd (set by
B<passwd> above).

Default: empty string

B<scheduler => I<scheduler_name>

Scheduler to be used by LVS for loadbalancing.
For an information on the available sehedulers please see
the ipvsadm(8) man page.

Default: "wrr"

B<persistent => I<n>

Number of seconds for persistent client connections.

B<netmask => I<w.x.y.z> | I<prefixlen>

Netmask to be used for granularity of persistent client connections.
IPv4 netmask should be specified in dotted quad notation.
IPv6 netmask should be specified as a prefix length between 1 and 128.

B<protocol = tcp> | B<udp> | B<fwm>

Protocol to be used. If the virtual is specified as an IP address and port
then it must be one of tcp or udp. If a firewall
mark then the protocol must be fwm.

Default:

=over 4

=item * Virtual is an IP address and port, and the port is not 53: tcp

=item * Virtual is an IP address and port, and the port is 53: udp

=item * Virtual is a firewall mark: fwm

=back

B<monitorfile = ">I</path/to/monitorfile>B<">

File to continuously log the real service checks to for this virtual
service. This is useful for monitoring when and why real services were down
or for statistics.

The log format is:
[timestamp|pid|real_service_id|status|message]

Default: no separate logging of service checks.

B<ops = >B<yes> | B<no>

Specify that a virtual service uses one-packet scheduling. This option
can be used only for UDP services. If this option is specified, all connections
are created only to schedule one packet. Option is useful to schedule
UDP packets from same client port to different real servers.

=head1 IPv6

Directives for IPv6 are virtual6, real6, fallback6.
IPv6 addresses specified for virtual6, real6, fallback6 and a file
of maintenance directory should be enclosed by
brackets ([2001:db8::abcd]:80).

Following checktype and service are supported.

B<checktype: >B<connect> | B<external> | B<external-perl> | B<negotiate> | B<off> | B<on> | B<checktimeout>I<N>

B<service: >B<dns> | B<http> | B<https> | B<nntp> | B<none> | B<simpletcp> | B<sip>

Note: When using a service type with http or https, you need to install perl module perl-Net-INET6Glue.

# ld_read_ipvsadm
#
# Net::FTP seems to set the input record separator ($\) to null
# putting IO into slurp (whole file at a time, rather than line at a time)
# mode. Net::FTP does this using local $\, which should mean
# that the change doesn' effect code here, but it does. It also
# seems to be impossible to turn it off, by say setting $\ back to '\n'
# Perhaps there is more to this than meets the eye. Perhaps it's a perl bug.
# In any case, this should fix the problem.
#
# This should not affect pid or config file parsing as they are called
# before Net::FTP and as this appears to be a bit of a work around,

# daemon
# Close and fork to become a daemon.

# Notes from unix programmer faq
# http://www.landfield.com/faqs/unix-faq/programmer/faq/
#
# Almost none of this is necessary (or advisable) if your daemon is being
# started by `inetd'.  In that case, stdin, stdout and stderr are all set up
# for you to refer to the network connection, and the `fork()'s and session
# manipulation should *not* be done (to avoid confusing `inetd').  Only the
# `chdir()' step remains useful.
#
# Gratuitously over documented, because it can be
#
# Written by Horms, horms@verge.net.au for an unrelated project while
# working for Zip World, http://www.zipworld.com.au/, 1997-1999.

	# use `sysconf()' to determine the limit `_SC_OPEN_MAX'.  `_SC_OPEN_MAX'
	# tells you the maximum open files/process. Then in a loop, the daemon
	# can close all possible file descriptors. You have to decide if you

	# and open `/dev/null' as stdin; alternatively, you could open
	# `/dev/console' as stderr and/or stdout, and `/dev/null' as stdin, or
	# any other combination that makes sense for your particular daemon.

	# This code used to open /dev/console for STDOUT and STDERR,
	# but that was changed to /dev/null to stop the code hanging in
